        "assistant": "Okay, here's an executive-level summary analyzing the week-over-week change in Gross Sales for the periods ending May 10th vs May 17th, based on the provided data, focusing on key trends and insights:\n\n**Executive Summary: Week-over-Week Gross Sales Analysis (May 10 vs. May 17)**\n\n*   **Overall Decline:** Gross Sales experienced a decrease of approximately -5.66% week-over-week, indicating a general downturn in sales performance.\n\n*   **Residential Sales Outperformance:** While overall sales decreased, Residential sales outperformed Mobility with a slight decline of -4.096385% compared to Mobility's -8.52%. This suggests relative strength in Residential products during this period.\n\n*   **Existing Customer Sales Decline:** Both Existing and New customer segments experienced sales decline, further confirming an overall negative trend.\n\n*   **DB Impression Change:** Digital Billboard impressions experienced substantial changes as well. Wireless DB had a decrease while wireline showed a slight increase. However, the Wireline DB gross sales decreased. This disparity could be due to other factors such as ad campaign performance.\n\n*   **Activation Rate Decline:** Both Residential and Mobility products experienced decline in activation rates, with a higher decline in Residential % (from 0.6530 to 0.7140) compared to Mobility (from 0.8429 to 0.7930). This suggests challenges in converting traffic into active customers.\n\n**Next Steps & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Investigate Cause of Decline:** Conduct further analysis to identify the root causes of the sales decline across both product categories and customer segments. Consider factors such as seasonality, promotional activity, competitive pressures, and external market events.\n\n*   **Residential Performance Assessment:** Deep dive into the drivers of relative success in Residential sales to identify potential best practices that can be applied to Mobility.\n\n*   **Address Activation Challenges:** Implement strategies to improve activation rates for both product lines. Optimize the customer onboarding process, refine messaging, and offer targeted incentives.\n\n*   **Optimize Database and Impressions Strategies**: Look for what caused the Wireless decline, and what the Wireline is doing better to see if it can be implemented on the Wireless side.\n"
